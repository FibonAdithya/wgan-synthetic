"""ANN-difficulty metrics for real-vs-synthetic descriptor comparison.

The EDA report next door compares distributional shape -- whether a synthetic
set *looks* like SIFT. These metrics ask the other question: whether it would
*behave* like SIFT under nearest-neighbour search. A generator can match mean,
variance, pairwise-distance median and effective rank while producing a set
that is far easier or harder to search than the real thing, which makes it
useless as a benchmark stand-in.

Everything here is computed from the vectors alone; no index is built. The
metrics are the published predictors of ANN hardness: local intrinsic
dimensionality, relative contrast, hubness, and partition balance.

All values are relative instruments. They are comparable across the sets
measured in one run and are *not* comparable with published figures for
SIFT1M, which are measured on the full 1M set against the real query set
rather than on a self-queried subsample.

This module deliberately does not import from eda_report: it must stay usable
and testable without plotly or argparse.
